title: Energy
description: The sustainability of energy and mineral resources within and
  around water bodies is important in the public discourse on the blue economy.
  With increasing primary energy demand across the key fuels (oil, coal, gas,
  biomass, nuclear, hydro, and other renewables), the whole subject of energy
  efficiency becomes a critical driver for sustained blue economy developments.
  Many countries and especially Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and SIDS rely
  directly on oceans, lakes, seas, and other water bodies which are the backbone
  of their existence. Sustainable marine energy exploration and development can
  play a vital role in social and economic growth, as well as in offering
  realistic climate adaptation and mitigation alternatives.
