title: " Water Use and Supply Management"
description: " Water plays a vital role in life sustenance on earth and will
  become increasingly critical in the future given the continuing population
  growth and economic development. There is growing and conflicting demand for
  water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes in the face of water
  scarcity, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to water, and habitat
  destruction and pollution, all of which affect water quality and quantity. The
  availability of and access to water has become one of the most important
  challenges that countries face today, and water resource management has become
  a major priority in most countries where water supply shortage is threatening
  their development. The ecosystem-based management approach ensures an
  integrated and holistic approach to the management of river basins down to the
  coastal and marine areas. This involves protection of forests, watersheds,
  wetlands, surface water (rivers, lakes, streams) and groundwater aquifers to
  ensure adequate water supply and acceptable water quality."
