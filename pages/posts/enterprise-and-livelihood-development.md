title: Enterprise and Livelihood Development
description: The concept of Blue Economy (BE) is recognized as central for
  sustainable development that incorporates socio-economic benefits and
  ecological conservation. However, in Africa, much of the emphasis on BE is
  placed on economic gains; as a result, traditional livelihoods and small-scale
  local operations are outcompeted by international corporations and government
  initiatives, with little or no regard for social inclusion and environmental
  sustainability. successful BE initiatives in Africa accentuate the involvement
  of local communities and promote sustenance of the natural ecosystem. Success
  in terms of the sustainability balance among ecological, social, and economic
  aspects.
