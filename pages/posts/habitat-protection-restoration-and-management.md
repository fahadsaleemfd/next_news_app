title: Habitat Protection, Restoration and Management
description: "The Nature Conservancy works to keep marine habitats healthy,
  while bringing degraded ones back to life. We work with partners like the
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States to
  restore important marine habitats, as well as with other governmental agencies
  around the world.  Through our coral reef resilience program, our global
  shellfish restoration work and interactive decision support to aid recovery
  and restoration efforts in the Gulf of Mexico, our goal is to increase the
  protection of 35 percent of the world’s coral reefs and 80 percent of oyster
  reefs. From shellfish reefs, sea grasses and kelp beds to mangroves, coral
  reefs, and salt marsh estuaries – coastal ecosystems are vitally important to
  people around the world, providing food and jobs as well as protecting
  communities from storm damage. Some habitats, like coral and shellfish reefs,
  are especially important to ocean health and human well-being. These habitats
  are also extremely threatened: Globally 85 percent of oyster reefs have been
  lost and 70 percent of coral reefs are threatened."
