title: Fisheries and Food Security
description: Food security involves food availability (production, food imports
  and food stocks) access to food (business, food stocks, employment /social
  protection), as well as food utilization (food and nutrition interventions for
  vulnerable groups /nutrition education). Further, the affordability of food
  promotes good societal health. Sustainable fisheries, maricultural and
  aquaculture are well placed to meaningfully contribute to the achievement of
  this objective. Climate change has increased the vulnerability of poor people
  and is compromising food security. Addressing availability and access to food
  and nutrition involves market-based economic development (inputs, outputs,
  finance, aquatic resources, and land), decentralization and price
  stabilization, as well as support to communities to withstand shocks and
  strengthen their resilience
