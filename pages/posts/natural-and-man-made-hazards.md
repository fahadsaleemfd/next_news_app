title: Natural and Man-made Hazards
description: Natural and man-made hazards include, for instance, droughts,
  desertification, floods, fires, earthquakes, and dispersion of radioactive
  gases in the atmosphere.  They have significant social, environmental, and
  economic impacts. Natural hazards are those resulting from an adverse
  interaction between a natural process and human society or its man-made
  environment. For most communities, natural hazards are the primary concern of
  disaster managers. Natural hazards that may be faced by a community are
  dictated largely by the climate, geography, geology, and land use practices of
  that community.
