title: Coastal Transport
description: Transportation in general and maritime transport remains the
  backbone of the world globalized economy. As the cheapest mode for bulk
  transportation with over 90 percent by volume and 70 percent by value of
  global trade, shipping and seaports are at the forefront of globalization.
  Therefore, maritime transport and related developments in transport
  technologies play a crucial role in the global economy. In Sweden maritime
  transport is estimated to handle about 90 percent of international trade and
  Pakistan can show a similar high dependence on shipping for the foreign trade
  to support various land locked countries in the region. Shipping, i.e., the
  ownership of the ships that carry merchandise, has become one of the most
  international activities in the world. Globalized production and distribution
  of goods require effective logistics with shippers focusing more on balancing
  inventory holding costs against transportation costs. Maritime transport
  services create job opportunities in among other areas, shipping, ship
  building and repairs, vessel registration, seafaring, port operations,
  insurance, shore based auxiliary support and financial services.
