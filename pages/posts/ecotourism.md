title: Ecotourism
description: The blue economy offers significant opportunities to improve
  livelihoods for all and sustainable urban development. Indeed, the
  contribution of the blue economy to land value in cities and the broad range
  of direct and indirect livelihood and economic opportunities are obvious.While
  it offers economic opportunities to all income levels, sandy beaches attract
  numerous tourism related activities such as leisure accommodation and water
  sports. With only investing 0.2 percent of total GDP in “greening” the tourism
  sector could result in 7 percent additional growth, like seen in Cambodia,
  Vietnam, Philippines, and Thailand. The scale and nature of these economic
  activities typically create proportional environmental impact and cost and
  given the frequent fragility of coastal zones and oceans; this needs careful
  management to ensure sustainability.
