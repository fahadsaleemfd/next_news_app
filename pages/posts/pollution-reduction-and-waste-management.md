title: Pollution Reduction and Waste Management
description: >-
  The cumulative release of pollutants to oceans and water bodies from point and
  non-point sources greatly affects the growth of blue economy. Specifically,
  non-sustainable agricultural activities along the water bodies promote
  increased pollution in freshwater bodies, seas, and oceans. The effects of
  pollution on oceans include depletion of oxygen content in the water, toxicity
  of the marine environment, contamination of food chains, hazard to human and
  aquatic health, hindrances to marine activities, disruption to reproductive
  systems and cycle of coral reefs, impairment of quality for use of water and
  reduction of amenities. Large algal blooms lead to very low levels of oxygen
  in water, killing fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants.


  The problem of marine litter into oceans is another major source of pollution. The World Economic Forum projects that in 2050, dumping of plastics into the oceans will be over 8 million tons per year resulting in more plastics than fish in the oceans. Itâ€™s estimated that over 10 percent of the total ocean contamination is caused by lost or discarded fishing gear which can result in entanglement and death of marine mammals and other aquatic organisms.
