title: Integrated Coastal Management(ICM), Development and Implementation
description: With the maturing of ICM, its scope has expanded to include
  regional or transnational projects and programs. Inherent linkages among
  terrestrial and ocean processes have led to several regional ocean
  initiatives; 16 regional action plans have been formally adopted as of 2001
  under the UNâ€™s Regional Seas Program. Each plan focuses on the unique problems
  of its region. For example, the East Asian Seas region has tackled problems of
  coastal aquaculture, fisheries exploitation, coral reef restoration, and
  resource extraction, using an ecoregion approach. Nations in the Western
  Indian Ocean region, where 70% of the African continent earn their living from
  natural resources, focus on simultaneously alleviating poverty and conserving
  natural resources. These developing regions promote sustainable livelihoods to
  meet both conservation and development goals.
